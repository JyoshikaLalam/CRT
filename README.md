## 📚 Problem Descriptions

Here’s a brief overview of the problems included in this repository:

| File                           | Language | Description                                                                    |
| ------------------------------ | -------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------ |
| `Bulb Switcher.py`             | Python   | Solves the bulb toggle problem using mathematical analysis of perfect squares. |
| `Factorial Trailing Zeroes.py` | Python   | Calculates the number of trailing zeroes in the factorial of a number.         |
| `Palindrome Number.py`         | Python   | Checks whether an integer is a palindrome.                                     |
| `Pow(x, n).py`                 | Python   | Efficiently computes `x` raised to the power `n` using fast exponentiation.    |
| `Reverse Intege.c`             | C        | Reverses digits of an integer using basic control structures in C.             |
